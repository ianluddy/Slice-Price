## Slice Scanner

Slice Scanner is a web application which aggregates data from the top pizza vendors in the country and presents it to the discerning pizza lover.
I used Bootstrap for the UI which is served up by a Flask application running behind Tornado. I used Selenium to scrape the data and AWS for deployment.

Slice Scanner was just a bit of fun and a chance to play with tools like Selenium and AWS, but if you have any feedback I'd like to hear it!
